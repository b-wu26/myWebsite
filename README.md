# myWebsite

Personal website made in react and hosted through aws on s3 but includes a custom SSL registration and a route 53 domain name, all linked through a cloudfront distribution specific endpoint can be found here: brendenwuweb.com
or http://brendenwuweb.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/about


note: Currently issues with email js account so no contact functionality available atm also the cloudfront is currently updating so some typos may exist on the cleaner domain name/the desired endpoint name may not be in service depending when you view it. If that is the case please use the 2nd endpoint
