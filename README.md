# myWebsite

Personal website made in react and hosted through aws on s3 but includes a custom SSL registration and a route 53 domain name, all linked through a cloudfront distribution specific endpoint can be found here: 
- brendenwuweb.com
- http://brendenwuweb.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com



note: Currently issues with email js account so no contact functionality available atm also the first endpoint should be in service, but if it fails, view from the 2nd link
